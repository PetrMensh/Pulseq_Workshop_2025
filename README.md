# Pulseq Workshop - September 2025

Hosted by The Quantitative MR Imaging Science (QIS) Lab, University of Bern, and The Translational Imaging Center (TIC), sitem-insel AG.

## About

This Pulseq Workshop was the first such event in Switzerland and aimed to bring together Magnetic Resonance researchers that want to develop MR pulse sequences in an open-source, vendor agnostic, format, namely Pulseq.

More information about the workshop can be found at: https://qis-mri.unibe.ch/workshop/

This repository hosts the outputs generated by the participants of this workshop.

## Safety check

As part of this workshop, the organising committee put together a matlab and python function (safety_check.m and safety_check.py) to calculate the peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) and acoustic resonance frequencies of the participants' sequences. The acoustic resonances, in particular, were checked before each sequence was run on the MRI scanners to reduce the risk of damaging the TIC's scanners.

To use these functions, you must first download and install either the matlab or python version of pulseq (https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq or https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq). The matlab function additionally relies on the safe_pns_prediction repository (https://github.com/filip-szczepankiewicz/safe_pns_prediction) which is included as a git submodule in this repository. It can be downloaded by running "git clone --recursive" when cloning this repository, or by using "git submodule update --init --recursive" if you have already cloned this repository.
